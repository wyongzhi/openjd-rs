# Step Dependency Graph

The `step_dependency_graph` module builds and queries a directed acyclic graph of step-to-step
dependencies from an instantiated `job::Job`.

## Public API

```rust
impl StepDependencyGraph {
    pub fn new(job: &Job) -> Result<Self, OpenJdError>
    pub fn step_node(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&StepDependencyNode>
    pub fn max_indegree(&self) -> usize
    pub fn max_outdegree(&self) -> usize
    pub fn topo_sorted(&self) -> Result<Vec<usize>, OpenJdError>
    pub fn topo_sorted_names(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>, OpenJdError>
}
```

## Types

```rust
pub struct StepDependencyGraph {
    nodes: Vec<StepDependencyNode>,
    edges: Vec<StepDependencyEdge>,
    name_to_index: HashMap<String, usize>,
}

pub struct StepDependencyNode {
    pub step_index: usize,
    pub name: String,
    pub in_edges: Vec<usize>,     // Indices into edges vec
    pub out_edges: Vec<usize>,    // Indices into edges vec
}

pub struct StepDependencyEdge {
    pub origin: usize,            // Index of dependency (upstream step)
    pub dependent: usize,         // Index of dependent (downstream step)
}
```

## Construction

`StepDependencyGraph::new(job)` builds the graph from an instantiated job:

1. Creates a node for each step, indexed by position in `job.steps`
2. Builds `name_to_index` lookup map
3. For each step's dependencies, creates edges from the dependency target to the step
4. Errors on unknown dependency targets (step name not found)

## Topological Sort

`topo_sorted()` returns step indices in dependency-respecting order using iterative
DFS-based topological sort with three-state marking.

**Algorithm:**
- Three states: Unvisited, Started (on stack), Completed
- Processes nodes in template order (index 0, 1, 2, ...)
- For each unvisited node, pushes dependencies in reverse template order before processing
- Completed nodes are prepended to the result (reverse post-order)
- Detects cycles via the Started state (back edge = cycle)

**Stability guarantee:** The sort is deterministic and matches the Python implementation's
behavior. Steps appear in template order unless dependency constraints force reordering.
This is important for reproducible scheduling.

`topo_sorted_names()` is a convenience wrapper that maps indices to step names.

## Design Decisions

### Edge-List Representation

The graph uses an edge-list representation with index-based references rather than
pointer-based adjacency. This avoids reference cycles (which the Python implementation
needs a manual `__del__` to handle) and is more cache-friendly.

### Stable Topological Sort

The iterative DFS-based sort processes nodes in template order and pushes dependencies in
reverse template order. This produces a stable, deterministic ordering that preserves
template order where dependency constraints allow.

### Cycle Detection at Two Levels

Cycles are detected in two places:
1. During template validation (Pass 3, `structure.rs`) using iterative DFS with tri-state
   marking
2. During `topo_sorted()` using the same DFS back-edge detection algorithm

The validation check catches cycles in templates before job creation. The `topo_sorted()`
check catches cycles in programmatically-constructed jobs that bypass template validation.
